### **Developing a Sustainable Leisure and Tourism Destination**
SDC strives to develop the resort island as a leading leisure and tourism destination in a sustainable manner. While the past few decades have seen rapid changes to the island with extensive development works, many parts of Sentosa still retain the original tranquil and green environment.

This is because SDC has adopted a balanced and sustainable approach to the development and growth of Sentosa and constant attention has been paid to protecting the greenery, heritage and island charm.

			To raise awareness for marine conservation and to encourage such efforts, 26 marine interest groups, conservation and research organisations including Our Singapore Reefs and Celebrating Singapore Shores linked up with SDC to jointly celebrate the third International Year of the Reef in Sentosa. 
			<br />
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	Held at the Palawan Pirate Ship from 17 to 18 March 2018, The Fun Odyssea was a free celebratory event that offered insights into Singapore’s shores, marine biodiversity and environmental issues through hands-on activities, interactive booths, and movie screenings. 
	<br />
	The opening ceremony was graced by Guest-of-Honour, Mr Andrew Tan, Chief Executive of Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. Guests at the event also had the chance to sign up for the free guided intertidal tours to the unique Siloso Headland, which is home to corals, seagrass, and a wide variety of marine life.

      <p>
	  	SDC is proud to have played a key role in contributing to the world’s population of endangered Hawksbill turtles! Following the discovery of a nest at Tanjong Beach in November 2017, various measures were put in place to ensure the safety of the Hawksbill turtle nest, to protect the eggs from natural predators like monitor lizards and crabs. SDC further worked closely with the National Parks Board to monitor the eggs daily during their incubation period.
	  </p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>
	In January 2018, 111 endangered hawksbill turtles emerged from the nest and made their way into the waters! Another batch of 102 eggs hatched at Tanjong Beach in September 2018, while the latest batch of 100 hatchlings made their way into the sea in September 2019.

			With 40 hectares of protected nature areas, more than 20 heritage trees, over 100 recorded bird species, and a variety of walking and cycling trails on the island, Sentosa is a haven for nature lovers. To bring guests closer to the island’s hidden gems, a slew of free nature activities was launched over the year, including the inaugural Siloso Headland Intertidal Programme.

	The guided programme explores Tanjong Rimau – one of Singapore’s last remaining coastal cliffs and rocky shores. Home to corals, seagrass and a wide variety of marine wildlife, Tanjong Rimau also boasts beautiful landscapes with an original and ageold rock outcrop.
