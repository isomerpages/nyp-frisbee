Play@NYP is an initiative by Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) and Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) that aims to foster
community spirit and create bonding opportunities for the Central Singapore CDC residents through various activities such as 
frisbee and art appreciation. 

Residents can look forward to a fun-filled day with exciting activities and fun learning stations lined up just for you.
