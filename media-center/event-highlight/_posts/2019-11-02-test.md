The **Community Art and Learning Festival** aims to foster community learning and art appreciation through a themed art exhibition and hands-on activities. The art exhibition features various art pieces done by our students based on our <span style="color:blue"><em> fairy-tale theme* </em></span> from the *Wizard of Oz*. Participants can walk down the <span style="color:#EBD30C"><em>yellow brick road </em></span> and look at the art pieces. 
In the Emerald City, there are **Fun Learning Activity Booths**, where participants can learn how to do *leathercrafting*, *frisbee painting*, *totebag stamping*, *shrink art*, *coaster colouring*.
