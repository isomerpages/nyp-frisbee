The art exhibition features our artwork done by NYP students based on their depiction of the well-known children’s tale – The Wizard of Oz. Participants can take a walk down the yellow brick road and explore the interesting art pieces with their families and friends. 
At the end of the exhibition, participants will enter the Emerald City where fun learning activity booths await them.  Participants can enjoy various craft activities such as leather crafting, frisbee painting, tote bag stamping and many more.
