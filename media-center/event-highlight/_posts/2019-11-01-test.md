The **Community Art & Learning Festival** aims to foster community learning and art appreciation through a themed art exhibition and hands-on activities. The art exhibition features various art pieces done by our students,based on a fairy-tale theme from the Wizard of Oz. Participants can walk down the yellow brick road and look at the art pieces. 

In the Emerald City, there are Fun Learning Activity Booths, where participants can learn how to do leathercrafting, frisbee painting, totebag stamping, shrink art, coaster colouring.
