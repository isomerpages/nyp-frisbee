The **Community Art & Learning Festival** aims to foster community learning and art appreciation through a themed art exhibition and hands-on activities. The art exhibition features various art pieces done by our students. <span style="color:blue"><em> *Fairy-tale theme* </em></span> from the *Wizard of Oz*.
