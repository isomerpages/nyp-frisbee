The **Community Art & Learning Festival** features our students' depiction of the classic fairy tale - <span style="color:blue"><em> *"Wizard of the Oz". Participants are invitied to take a walk down the <span style="color:#EBD30C"><em> yellow brick road </em></span> and immerse themselves in this magical world decorated with creative art sculptures and paintings. Amist these, we hope to spark interesting conversation between the residents and sharing on their intepretation of this well known tale. 
  
At the end of the exhibition, participants will enter the **Fun Learning Activity Booths** -  Emerald City, where participants are welcomed by a series of exciting hands-on activities including *leathercrafting*, *frisbee painting*, *totebag stamping*, *shrink art*, *coaster colouring*. At the end of the session, participants can bring their wonderful creations back as a keepsake of the event.
